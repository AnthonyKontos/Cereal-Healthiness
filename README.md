# Cereal-Healthiness
In this analysis we will be using descriptive statistics and basic visualizations to distinguish healthy cereals from unhealthy cereals.

## Conclusion 
The Bran shelf has the healthiest cereals as 2/3 of the healthy cereals
are bran (if we assume all the nutritional standards for healthiness are met).


Some conclusions we can make about the cereal dataset is that there are generally
very few cereals that meet ALL the nutritional standards for 'healthy'. Statistically
speaking, rice and wheat cereals are also the most beloved cereals among the general public
as they carry the highest avg, min, and max ratings. On the other hand, Crunch cereals 
are the least beloved, with the lowest avg, min, and max ratings. Cereals which meet at least
one nutritional standard for healthiness are also rated higher by avg and min ratings; however,
the max rating for unhealthy cereals is significantly higher than for cereals meeting at least one standard
of unhealthiness.
